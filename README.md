# HRY418-project-2

Parallelize a simple program in C using SSE and mpi. Use the script to compile and run all the files. Needs lamboot and MPICH to run.

The program computes a simplified version of Ï‰ statistic for N random data and prints the greatest value. Also it times the calculations. 


# Script

Executes all versions with 4 different data sizes. Also runs mpi with 2, 4 and 8 processes.
